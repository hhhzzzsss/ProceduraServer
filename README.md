# Procedura Server
A local server for managing and creating procedural builds in Minecraft

This repo includes the golang code that I've written for my various procedural creations. Each folder in `GeneratorPrograms/cmds` contains a separate entrypoint.
My workflow usually involves opening the `GeneratorPrograms` in VSCode, writing whatever build code I want, and then running it with a command like `go ./cmds/blue_mandelbulb`.
